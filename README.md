Database
========

Implementing the SQLite-3 database in iOS.

Add libsqlite3.dylib to the framework.

I haven't uploaded the complete application but this is the template that shows how the 
main functionalities of database are implemented in objective-C.

Functionality:

1. Create database.
2. Open table.
3. Insert values to table.
4. Display the values in the table.
5. Count the rows in the table.
6. Delete the rows in the table.
7. Getting the first row in the table.
8. Drop the table.
